                <p>Today, the pace of people's lives is getting faster and faster, but as a result, our environment is changing worse and worse. climate change, golbal warming, everything shows that the environment around us is dramatically deteriorated.</p>
                <hr class="my-2">
                <h2 class="display-5">Climate Warming</h2>
                <p>Since 1900, the global average temperature has risen by 0.7 degrees Celsius, and the northern hemisphere is substantially warmer than at any point during the past 1,000 years.</p>
                 <p>The evidence clearly shows that the cause of this change is the emission of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide) into the Earth’s atmosphere as a direct result of human activities, which include burning fossil fuels for energy, transport and a host of other purposes, and clearing forests and other ecosystems that absorb carbon from the atmosphere.</p>
                <hr class="my-2">
                <h2 class="display-5">Effect</h2>
                <img src="IMG/141515520529_.pic_hd.jpg">
                <p>As the ocean temperature rises, water evaporation accelerates and a large amount of water vapor is transported into the atmosphere, causing a sudden increase in rainfall in a short period of time in some areas. In such a rainstorm, floods, landslides and debris flow occur more frequently. The coastal cities and the vast area downstream of the river are therefore threatened by floods, whose floodplains have rapidly expanded due to the short-term heavy rainfall and the problems of water and soil loss have become more serious than in the past.</p>

                <p>In June 2012, scientists found that water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico between islands such as Greenland have risen due to global warming, causing the polar bears to dissolve on the ice where they survive, and they have to migrate for dozens of miles in search of new habitats and food. Scientists are concerned that they think there will be no more ice sheets in the Arctic in a few years, which is a deadly threat to polar bears.</p>
